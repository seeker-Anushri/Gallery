# 🎉 Welcome to the Fantastic Random Image Gallery! 📸✨


## 🌟 Project Description

Get ready to dive into a visually stunning and ever-changing world of images with our Random Image Gallery! This project showcases a delightful feed of six random images from the "Lorem Pixel" website, refreshing each time you visit the page. Plus, there's a magical button at the bottom to add even more random images at your whim. Using JavaScript to fetch images from the "Lorem Pixel" API, we manipulate the DOM to create a dynamic and engaging gallery experience. Stylish CSS adds the finishing touch, making this project a fantastic learning journey into fetching API data, DOM manipulation, and image styling.
